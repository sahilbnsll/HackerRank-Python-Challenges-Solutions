# Nested Lists

# Given the names and grades for each student in a class of  students, store them in a nested list and print the name(s) of any student(s) having the second lowest grade.

# Note: If there are multiple students with the second lowest grade, order their names alphabetically and print each name on a new line.

# Example

# The ordered list of scores is , so the second lowest score is . There are two students with that score: . Ordered alphabetically, the names are printed as:

# alpha
# beta
# Input Format

# The first line contains an integer, , the number of students.
# The  subsequent lines describe each student over  lines.
# - The first line contains a student's name.
# - The second line contains their grade.

# Constraints

# There will always be one or more students having the second lowest grade.
# Output Format

# Print the name(s) of any student(s) having the second lowest grade in. If there are multiple students, order their names alphabetically and print each one on a new line.

# Sample Input 0

# 5
# Harry
# 37.21
# Berry
# 37.21
# Tina
# 37.2
# Akriti
# 41
# Harsh
# 39
# Sample Output 0

# Berry
# Harry
# Explanation 0

# There are  students in this class whose names and grades are assembled to build the following list:

# python students = [['Harry', 37.21], ['Berry', 37.21], ['Tina', 37.2], ['Akriti', 41], ['Harsh', 39]]

# The lowest grade of  belongs to Tina. The second lowest grade of  belongs to both Harry and Berry, so we order their names alphabetically and print each name on a new line.
